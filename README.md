I used the project beginner-package from this Youtube tutorial and followed the video to write most of the code. 
Among them, the animation resource is modified by me using photoshop. In level3, this resource is not complete. 
The game stutters when the player is leveling up but after multiple clicks it works fine. 
Although there is no UI display, when the player chooses to upgrade the item, the HP will be reduced by 1 point as gold coins to pay.
